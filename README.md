# Practical_Satistics

## John Tukey, the eminent statistician whoes ideas developed over 50 yearsago
At the heart of statistics lies "variability": measuring it, reducing it, distinguishing random from real variability, identifying the various sources of real variability, and making decisions in the presence of it.

### Key terms for variability Metrics 

- Deviations: The difference between the observed values and the estimate of location. Synnyms: Errors, residuals;
- Variance: The sum of sequared deviation from the mean devided by n-1 where n is the number of data values;
- Standard deviation: the square root of the variance
